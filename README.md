### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I consider myself as a proactive person willing to take on new challenges to learn from them and adapt quickly for the benefit of the company. My academic background in biomedicine and full-stack developer has allowed me to develop skills in research, analysis, management of different programming languages, and above all teamwork. So far, in addition to Spanish, I am fluent in English and German.
